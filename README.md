This repository showcases predictive modeling projects from my CodSoft's data science internship. It includes:

Titanic Survival: Random Forest model to predict survival probabilities.
Movie Rating Prediction: Linear Regression model to predict movie ratings.
Iris Classification: Random Forest model for iris flower species classification.
Sales Prediction: Linear Regression model for sales forecasting.
Credit Card Fraud Detection: Logistic Regression model to identify fraudulent transactions.

Each project includes preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to enhance model accuracy and insights.
Explore detailed Jupyter Notebooks for methodologies, visualizations, and insights gained from each predictive modeling task.
